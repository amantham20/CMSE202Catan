# CMSE202Catan


GP 100 Generation Sim contains our Second Approach to the Problem, which was to create generations of bots and have those bots play each other to determine the most "fit" bots, which would then used to create the net generation.

The bots in this simulation contains 12 different weights, which account for the 4 main moves that can be made in Catan (Building a City, Building a Settlement, Buying Development Cards, and Building Roads) in 3 different stages of the game (Early, Mid, and Late)
